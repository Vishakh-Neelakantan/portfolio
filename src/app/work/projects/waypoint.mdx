## Overview
The Route Planner App is a full-stack geospatial web application designed to generate optimal round-trip paths across multiple travel modes, including walking, jogging, and cycling. It leverages the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) for efficient route calculations and provides an interactive user experience through a modern frontend framework.

## Features
- Developed a full-stack geospatial web app to generate optimal round-trip paths across 3+ travel modes (<strong>walking</strong>, <strong>jogging</strong>, <strong>cycling</strong>) using <strong>OSRM</strong>.
- Optimized routes processed in less than <strong>1.2s</strong> via a modular <strong>FastAPI backend</strong> using <strong>geopy</strong> and <strong>pydantic</strong>, deployed on <strong>Railway</strong>.
- Built an interactive frontend with <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and <strong>Leaflet.js</strong>, achieving map rendering speeds under <strong>750ms</strong> with <strong>Vercel</strong> deployment.
